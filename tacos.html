    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Dice potatoes into chunks slightly smaller than sugar cubes</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan that has a lid to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add a table spoon of vegetable oil then add diced potatoes to the pan.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste and taco seasoning or red chile powder also to taste.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook potatoes for about ten minutes or until soft.</li>
        <li>You can uncover them for a few minutes in order to crisp the outside of the potatoes a little.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking, brown then drain your ground beef</li>
        <ul>
            <li>You can also add seasoning to taste to your ground beef.</li>

        <li>Season to taste again.</li>
        <li>At this point you can optionally add a can of corn or a can of drained black beans.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>Heat the tortillas either in the microwave or on the stove a few at a time as needed before serving.</li>
        <li>At this point you can put together your tacos with whatever optional garnish you'd like.</li>
