    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe requires a pressure cooker. You can also make this in a slow cooker but will have to increase the hours. But this is an easy and quick recipe to make at the end of a long day.</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>2-4 Chicken Breasts.</li>
        <li>1-2 Cups of Barbeque Sauce of your choosing</li>
        <li>Water or Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>Recommended/Optional ingredients</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread, or buns.</li>
            <li>Sliced pickles</li>
            <li>Diced Onions</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Extra BBQ Sauce</li>
        </ul>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Spray a little cooking oil or pour a little oil on the bottom of your pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Trim Chicken if needed and lay chicken breasts on bottom of pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Pour the cups of Barbeque Sauce on the chicken.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The sauce should comfortably cover the chicken breasts, so this is where you can add about a half a cup or less of chicken broth or water, to make sure that there is enough liquid to cover the chicken breasts. However you do not want it to be too watery.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>Add seasoning of your choosing, but usually BBQ sauce is enough.</li>
        <li>Put the pressure cooker to cook for 30-40 minutes.</li>
        <li>when the chicken is done, shred each chicken breast into a bowl with two forks.</li>
        <li>Pour a little of the remaining sauce from the pressure cooker into the bowl.</li>
        <li>At this point you can prepare it however you'd like using the option ingredients above. And with a side of your choosing.</li>
